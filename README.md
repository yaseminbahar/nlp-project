In this project I will analyse reviews of Turkish Airlines. I will fetch reviews from http://www.airlinequality.com/Forum/turkish.htm website.
Every reviews have following structural fields along with the free form review itself.
Customers are allowed to evaluate airlines using multi-criteria e.g. catering, staff service, seat comfort, cabin flown...

1. Rating : 8/10

I will extract adjectives from reviews using OpenNLP Part of Speech tagger tool. 

I will visualize, top used adjectives and ratings per country using a heat map.
In short there will be three dimensions : adjectives, countries, ratings.
I will try  visualize that  3-dimensions data in a meaningful way using a data visualization software.

Data visualization or data visualisation is viewed by many disciplines as a modern equivalent of visual communication. It is not owned by any one field, 
but rather finds interpretation across many (e.g. it is viewed as a modern branch of descriptive statistics by some, but also as a grounded theory development 
tool by others).(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization)
